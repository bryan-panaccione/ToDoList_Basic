# ToDoList_Basic
This repository is a How-To on creating a JS/HTML/CSS To-Do list. It is not functional on its own, the pages are not linked and the HTML is a snippet of what is required to execute the JS.  The JS, HTML and CSS files in this repository are heavily commented, describing what each line or section of code is responsible for. Using these comments and the code provided, a beginner will be able to gain significant understanding of the DOM.

Functionalities of this To Do List include:
Add Tasks
Delete Tasks
Mark Tasks as complete
Save Task list
Clear tasks from DOM
Pull most recent saved task
Press "Save" button on an empty list to clear localStorage

This to do lists uses localStorage() to save and pull previously typed to do lists.
